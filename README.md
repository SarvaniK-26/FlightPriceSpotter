# FlightPriceSpotter
Soon I will be going to San Deigo for grad school but need to fly on a budget. I have built a bot with python that sends me emails when there are affordable flights to San Deigo right before school begins.

Python environment was set up through Anaconda (3.9). 
Python Libraries used:
- Beautiful Soup
- MIMEText
- smtplib
